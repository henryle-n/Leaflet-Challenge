# Weekly Earthquake Updates
Among all natual disasters known to human kind, earthquake probably is one of the most devastated one. A significant earthquake undersea could trigger a tsunami that has no problem causing damages to multiple countries. It's hard to believe but earthquake happens everyday around the globe ranging from <1 Richter (registered on seismograph, but not felt) to hard-rocking 7+ Richter (major damage to populated areas). 

Where are these quakes? Thanks to United States Geological Survey (USGS), earthquakes are tracked and published on USGS website. In this project, an interactive earthquake map was developed to allow users visualize not only the locations of these events but also their magnitudes (in step-1) as well as how earthquakes are related to tectonic plates (Fault Lines, step-2). This map contains many features such as map color, type, fault lines that can be easily turned on or off.
